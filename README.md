# Academic Template for [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo)

This is a stripped down version of the [Hugo Academic template](https://github.com/wowchemy/starter-academic). For full features of this template, [see the **documentation**](https://wowchemy.com/docs/).

I created this template as a quick way for job market candidates to set up their website. The colours come from McGill's [visual identity guide](https://www.mcgill.ca/visual-identity/visual-identity-guide).


##Start Up Instructions

- Clone repo
```bash
git clone git@github.com:EvanJo/McHugo.git
